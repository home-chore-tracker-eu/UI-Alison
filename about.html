          <h2>Earn XP</h2>
          <p>Allocate XP (experience points) to each chore, kids earn XP as they complete tasks and can level up for rewards</p>
          <p>Children who consider themselves necessary to the family are less likely to feel adrift in a world where a
            core human need is to feel needed. Children who earn their privelleges rather than just being automatically
            entitled to them are more likely to value what they have.
            The best predictor for young adults success in mid 20’s is whether they participated in household tasks age 3/4.

        <p>Getting children to do chores is often far from easy but it’s actually quite simple: insist and persist. When
          new chores are assigned it’s beneficial to show your kids how to do them, and do the chores with them
          the first few times until they get the hang of it.  <strong>I do, we do, you do.</strong>   Then give them the responsibility to do the chores on their
          own. Strive to not buy into excuses and accept that you may need to repeat yourself over and over. .</p>
