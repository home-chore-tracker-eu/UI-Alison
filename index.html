          <p>What message are you sending to your children? .</p>
          <p>Besides the practical benefits of everyone mucking in, children have psychological-developmental needs
            related to doing chores.
            It’s healthy for kids to contribute at home. Being a part of the ongoing work of running a household helps
            children develop an awareness of the needs of others, while at the same time contributing to their own
            emotional well being</p>

          <h2>Belonging and Pride</h2>
          <p>Children who consider themselves necessary to the family are less likely to feel adrift in a world where a
            core human need is to feel needed. Children who earn their privelleges rather than just being automatically
            entitled to them are more likely to value what they have.
            The best predictor for young adults success in mid 20’s is whether they participated in household tasks age 3/4.

        <p>Getting children to do chores is often far from easy but it’s actually quite simple: insist and persist. When
          new chores are assigned it’s beneficial to show your kids how them how to do them, and do the chores with them
          the first few times until they get the hang of it. Then give them the responsibility to do the chores on their
          own. Strive to not buy into excuses and accept that you may need to repeat yourself over and over. .</p>
