          <p>What message are you sending to your children? .</p>
          <p>Besides the practical benefits of everyone mucking in, children have psychological-developmental needs
            related to doing chores.
            It’s healthy for kids to contribute at home. Being a part of the ongoing work of running a household helps
            children develop an awareness of the needs of others, while at the same time contributing to their own
            emotional well being</p>

          <h2>Belonging and Pride</h2>
          <p>Children who consider themselves necessary to the family are less likely to feel adrift in a world where a
            core human need is to feel needed. Children who earn their privelleges rather than just being automatically
            entitled to them are more likely to value what they have. <br> <br>
            The best predictor for young adults success in mid 20’s is whether they participated in household tasks age
            3/4.

        <h2>Start Building Lifelong Habits Now</h2>
        <p>Getting children to do chores is often far from easy but it’s actually quite simple: insist and persist. When
          new chores are assigned, show your kids how them how to do them, and do the chores with them
          the first few times until they get the hang of it. Then give them the responsibility to do the chores on their
          own. Strive to not buy into excuses and accept that you may need to repeat yourself over and over.

        <h2>Children should do chores . . . . Period.</h2>
        <p>A common counter arguement is that a child is too young, this has been disproven. multiple studies point to
          the fact that mucking
          in with developmentally appropriate tasks will give your child the best start in life. Helping out at home,
          equips them with essential life skills that grow gradually as they do. It gives them a sense of responsibility
          and
          accomplishment and teaches them to exist and interact appropriately in society. We would not expect a child to
          launch
          in the adult world fully formed. Viewed through this lens, it seems remiss to not arm them with these
          essential values
          and skills? <br> 
          Doing everything for and on behalf of a child teaches them a level of entitlement that cannot be sustained
          outside the family unit and will cause then problems as they grow up and interact with the wider community.
